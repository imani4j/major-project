# Plan
## I have decided to give up on my old idea for the major project, as I ran into too many problems regarding the asynchronous nature of loading images and the timing of prompts. I will consider doing it again in the future, but for now I've decided to only do the hunting game
### This is just a place to organize my thoughts and stuff. I'd use paper, but since I'll be working from two different places its better to just have it digitally instead of trusting myself to bring a paper everyday

## plan stuff goes down here
