###The Milky Way but its only the hunting game (a the Oregon Trail parody)

~This game will feature aliens travelling through the Milky way to get to Earth. I plan to make it similar to the Oregon Trail,  but with aliens and no educational value. Players will have to purchase resources before going on their trip, and will then have to manage them during their treacherous journey. Having random unfortunate events happen (like having your wagon sink and losing all your party members, or randomly getting dysentry in the original game) is highly preferable, but I don't have much time, so we'll see.~

I have decided to give up on my old idea for the major project, as I ran into too many problems regarding the asynchronous nature of loading images and the timing of prompts. I will consider doing it again in the future, but for now I've decided to only do the hunting game part of it.

This game will feature aliens travelling through the Milky Way to get to Earth. They've run out of food, so they have to hunt space cows. This is effectively a minigame that would be present in the full game.

## Needs To Have
- Bullets
- Prey
- Hitboxes
- A score system
- Sprites
- Music
- Having to hunt enough to feed your party for the week (if you do not succeed, party health goes down)

## Nice To Have
- Different difficulty levels
- 24 different "levels" (weeks that you have to provide food until they arrive at earth)
- Self-made assets (sprites, as well as sound effects and music) (very good chance at least some of this will be achieved)
