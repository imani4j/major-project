# Proposal
###The Milky Way (a the Oregon Trail parody)

This game will feature aliens travelling through the Milky way to get to Earth. I plan to make it similar to the Oregon Trail,  but with aliens and no educational value. Players will have to purchase resources before going on their trip, and will then have to manage them during their treacherous journey. Having random unfortunate events happen (like having your wagon sink and losing all your party members, or randomly getting dysentry in the original game) is highly preferable, but I don't have much time, so we'll see.

## Needs To Have
- Resource Management (spare parts, warm clothes, food, money)
- Trading
- Random Unfortunate Events (getting hit by an asteroid maybe?)
- Sprites
- Music

## Nice To Have
- Diseases (randomly getting dysentry is necessary for the Oregon Trail feel)
- Hunting minigame (maybe hunting space cows? idk aliens like cows right)
- Interesting landmarks (all fictional) (will require drawings, which has to do with the next point)
- Self-made assets (sprites, as well as sound effects and music) (very good chance at least some of this will be achieved)
