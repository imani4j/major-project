# Reflection
## Problem #1: Original idea was too ambitious for deadline
The biggest problem by far was the fact I was so set on making an entire *The Oregon Trail* parody that I didn't give up and start working on the game I decided to go with until very late. I had tons of functions ready and an entire plan for how to go through with making that game, but my entire approach was wrong, which I'll get into later. I should've looked into how the user would input things earlier on, so that I could have either adapted properly to fit that or switched ideas earlier.

## Problem #2: Lack of understanding with how JS functions
The main reason why I had to switch ideas was because I didn't really know how JS worked. I didn't understand how HTML and CSS and JS work together, and how if you want user input its almost necessary to use HTML. When I eventually figured this out, instead of changing my approach, I decided to avoid it entirely and try to do everything in JS. This was a massive faux pas and can be considered the reason why that idea ultimately failed. I kept trying to make my own button with a rectangle, or use a library, or just use window promps with setTimeout. 
Since Javascript doesnt always wait for things to finish before it moves on, it kept putting up window prompts before images, which ruined a fundemental part of the game. If I'd just set the images as backgrounds and used input boxes instead, this game might have been a success

## Competed everything?
I completed everything on my new needs list, and some things on my nice to have list.

## Needs To Have
- ~Bullets~
- ~Prey~
- ~Hitboxes~ (technically not, but they werent needed as i just used the images coordinates, so i think that counts)
- ~Sprites~
- ~Music~

## Nice To Have
- ~A score System~
- Having to hunt enough to feed your party for the week (if you do not succeed, party health goes down)
- Different difficulty levels
- 24 different "levels" (weeks that you have to provide food until they arrive at earth)
- ~Self-made assets (sprites, as well as sound effects and music)~ ~(very good chance at least some of this will be achieved)~
i made moo sound effects, little sis made sprites, rest were from opengameart
